"""
lookning at generative adversarial networks in torch
we use dnn for supervised learning: identify which image or which object in the image
supervised: have some data and then create a model that do similar predictions on other nn
generative modeling: unsupervised learning task: only the data
involves learnign the data so that you can output new examples that you can ge tfrom original dataset that look similar to original ds
